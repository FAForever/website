      h2 Enjoy the nostalgia with friends
      p FAF has implemented the co-op feature into the campaign. This means now you can play either of the four original campaigns with up to three friends (four players)! But! That's not all, FAF contributors are also working on creating two new campaigns! One for Seraphim and another one for the coalition! However, be warned that the new campaigns are meant to present a real challenge to seasoned players. If you need some help or have questions, feel free joining the FAF Campaign Development Discord or the FAF Discord!

      h2 Help develop or create your own mission!
      p As you may be thinking, a lot of these new campaigns or missions are being developed by FAF contributors. Therefore, it is possible for you to create one too! Albeit it can be challenging at first if you don't have much experience, many FAF contributors can guide and help you at first so you can create your own custom missions! Just join the Campaign Development Discord and ask around!
