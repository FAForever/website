        h1 And you are done with GOG linking forever!
          p Now if you want, you can set your privacy settings back to private and your profile's about you to normal.

        h2 Why do I need to link my Steam/GOG account to FAF?
          p FAF as an organization doesn't own the copyright or trademark to SC:FA (Square Enix does). <br> Therefore, we need to verify you own a copy of SC:FA to protect ourselves from legal repercussions.
          p Linking your GOG account to FAF doesn't provide us with any information or powers over your account. <br> Only the fact that you own Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance. <br> Which is why we need you to set your Game Details to public when linking your account.
