				h4.contribution-subtitle.text-center In order to play Supreme Commander with other players, you must download one of
					|  the following clients. As an open source community, we provide two different clients that provide SIMILAR functionality.
					| Downlord's FAF client is a more active version of the client, and is still in ALPHA stages. Whereas, the Forged Alliance Forever client
					| is not as active, but is stable. <strong>We currently recommend that you use the stable Forged Alliance Forever client.</strong>
