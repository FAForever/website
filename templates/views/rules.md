# Forged Alliance Forever rules

The rule changes below are not retroactive and are for the moment subject to change as we work towards improving and consolidating the rules. Keep in mind that lobby rules in essence apply not only to #aeolus but also to your in-game behavior. If you have any suggestions or concerns please contact the IRC moderator usergroup.

To report infractions of other users, it is recommended to use this form:

FAF moderation is active on all platforms and services that Forged Alliance Forever provides. This includes the clients, in-game, the forums and other platforms such as slack and discord.

## Overview:

Everything on FAF is subject to the Terms of Service here: [TOS](https://www.faforever.com/tos)

This is a short overview of the rules. For any moderating purpose, only the complete rules will be taken into account : this summary is for your information only.

- **Do not harass, defame, or discriminate** other players based on their sexual orientation, gender, race, culture, religion, nationality.
- **Do not invade other people's privacy.**
- **Do not use FAF to violate any laws.**
- **Do not abuse by using multiple accounts.**
- **Do not manipulate your account information.**
- **Do not abuse any game bugs and/or exploits.** [Exploits are listed here](http://forums.faforever.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=11322#p116202)
- **Do not discuss drugs, illegal content or pornography.**
- **Do not spam nor impersonate any other user, or take bots names.**
- **Do not friendly fire, reclaim or teamkill allies.**

**You are responsible for everything you do!**


**By using FAF services you agree to the rules detailed in this post.**
- If you don't comply with the FAF rules, the moderation team can and will **warn, kick, or/and ban** you from using FAF services.

## FAF Rules:
*By using FAF you agree to the rules defined in this forum post. For the purposes of moderation, the english translation will be used, and other translations are intended for clarity & reference only. These rules add-up to the FAF Terms of Service, but do not replace it in any way.*

- Respecting other community members is important. You will always respect your fellow community members. You will not harass or attack other users. You will respect the rights of other users to have their own opinions.

- You will not communicate any material that is knowingly false and/or defamatory, inaccurate, abusive, hateful, harassing, derogatory to someone’s sexual orientation, race, culture, religion, threatening, invasive of a person’s privacy or in violation of any law. 

- For your protection, you should not send any personal identifiable information about yourself in your messages.

- Action may be taken on a user account without prior warning or notice. You remain solely responsible for your behaviour and actions and you agree that FAF and it's agents are blameless if actions are taken toward you or your accounts.

- Objectionable content should be brought to the attention of the moderation team immediately. Send a private message to a moderator in chat or to the IRC Moderator usergroup on the forums, or submit a report form from here : and the matter will be processed as soon as possible. 

- Do not create copies of maps already in the vault with minor tweaks without asking the M+M Councillor or anyone they ask to arbitrate.

- Do not create copies of mods already in the vault with minor tweaks without asking the M+M Councillor or anyone they ask to arbitrate.

Avoiding penalties applied to you by the moderation team via any means is forbidden, and will result in an extension of the penalties.
Helping others with breaking FAF rules or avoiding penalties is also forbidden, and carries a similar punishment.
For example, sharing an account or playing with a banned user who is avoiding their penalty will result in a ban of both users.

## In-game Rules:
**All of the rules for FAF apply ingame**, excluding the english language requirement.

- You will **not exploit any bugs or loopholes** in any of the services. You can find a list of exploits here: [exploits](http://forums.faforever.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=11322)

- If you discover any exploit report it to tech support: [tech support](http://forums.faforever.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=12531) 
- You will not **lose on purpose** to lower your rating, your rating can be reset in addition to any other sanctions that may apply.
- You will **not manipulate your rating** in any way.
- You will **not ruin the game intentionally** by any means.
- You will not **reclaim or teamkill/friendly fire** allies.
- You will **not slow or block the game from progressing.**

## Rules on UI mods:

We will list what sort of UI mods are not allowed here. This includes:
- All reclaim macros
- All autoclickers

If you are unsure if what you are using/developing is allowed, send a message to the moderation team, which contains instructions on how to find said mod/a download link, a description and we will inform you as soon as possible.
This list may change. 

## Communicating on FAF
When communicating through FAF the following is prohibited:
- Discussions regarding drugs and illegal substances
- Advertisement of goods and services, and commercially oriented material that is not a part of the FAF community or services.
- Pornographic, sexually offensive material, and material not suited for a family/office environment.
- Discussing or offering pirated material, or links to such.
- Messages containing copyrighted material unless that material is owned by the sender or by FAF.
- Discussing acts of illegal nature.
- Discussing moderation decisions in public is discouraged. Channels exist for appealing processes and raising concerns about moderation.
- Using usernames that are offensive or mimicking other FAF users.
- Impersonating a member of the community staff or any FAF user, or breaking bots by taking their names.
- Spam or content of a spammy nature, and material that degrades the quality of the communication medium.

The userbase for this lobby is international in nature, as such #aeolus is generally reserved for English chat. Quick questions or brief conversations in other languages are allowed, but if asked to stop, they should quickly.
There are language channels for **#russian, #german** and **#french**. 

**The creation of IRC bots to enhance chat is encouraged, provided they behave in an appropriate manner.**

### Bot rules:
ALL bots must be registered with the IRC mod team before they are used or they will be banned.

The following guidelines should be adhered to wherever possible:

1. Commands should in general have cooldowns.

    -  Any commands which generate significant output (this can be multiple lines, or one long line of text) should have a cooldown to prevent abuse.
 The recommended cooldown is at least 60 seconds.

    - Other commands may also require cooldowns depending on usage.


2. To avoid disturbing other users, bots should only ping or otherwise directly interact with a user if:

    - the user has explicitly permitted the given interaction. This can be by previously signing up to be pinged by the command, or if the user launched the given command.

    - the user of the command has specifically identified the ping recipient in the command.


3. All bots should make reasonable efforts to not overlap on specific commands. This is to avoid multiple bots responding to the same command. This can be achieved by using different keywords, or restricting access to particular users for that command.

4. FAF rules apply to the bot as they would for any user, so a bot posting derogatory material about other users is liable.

5. The owner of the bot is responsible for the bots actions, and can have penalties applied to them.

Finally, the moderators have the final decision on whether or not a bot behaves unsuitably. The above guidelines should be considered as an addition to the other chat rules.
Any bots deemed inappropriate are liable to be banned.
## Forum rules:
In addition to the FAF rules:

We reserve the right to delete, lock, move and edit any posts on the message board. Action may be taken on a post or on a user account without prior warning or notice. **You remain solely responsible for the content of your posts**, FAF and its agents are blameless if actions are taken toward you or your accounts.
## Violations and Penalties:
If, for any reason, you are in violation of any of the rules of FAF then your privileges to use FAF services will be reviewed by the moderation team. The penalties range from being given a severe warning as to future conduct, a timed ban (for a specified time), a total forum/lobby ban (you may still play on FAF) or a total FAF ban (you will not be able to play on FAF). 
If the matter warrants it then you might also be reported to your ISP/appropriate authorities. 

**The moderation team has the final say over what constitutes a violation of these Community Rules, and reserve the right to apply penalties at their discretion.**

- Warnings and notices from community staff will be sent via private message. It is your responsibility to check your private messages for any notices that may occur. 
- All situations will be dealt with on a case by case basis.

- Testing the boundaries of the rules will often result in more severe penalties, and the boundaries of the rules are reserved for the moderation team to define. Attempts to incite action from and harrass the moderation team will result in penalties, just as they would for other members of the FAF community.
- Minor infractions that do not justify a penalty alone will be nonetheless recorded and when a sufficient number is reached, penalties can be applied.
- Repeat offenses are taken seriously. If you do not apply effort in changing your behaviour for the better, penalties that are more severe will be applied, and could escalate into a total FAF ban from a series of minor infractions.
## Appealing bans & contacting moderation
If you feel you have been mistreated or that your ban is unjustified, you can always appeal moderation decisions by contacting the moderation team. 
You can also always contact a moderator via private messages, either via the forums or the chat in the client.
The official way is to send a message to the moderation team via the forums, as shown in this picture:
